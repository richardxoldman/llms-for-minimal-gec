# llms-for-minimal-gec

The repository contains code to reproduce models from the paper Adapting LLMs for Minimal-edit Grammatical Error Correction.

The datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/richardxoldman/detokenized-gec-datasets). 

Before running the script install environment from env.yml file.

For inference we recommend using the vLLM framework (code available in inf_model.py file).
